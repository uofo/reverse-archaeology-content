_“In that searing moment, I realized the loss he was describing was, in a crucial way, the collective loss. It was the loss of a massive web of connections - a way of being - that had been destroyed by urban renewal; it was as if thousands of people, who seemed to be with me in sunlight, were at some deeper level of their being wandering lost in a dense fog, unable to find one another for the rest of their lives.”_
Dr. Mindy Thompson Fullilove, Root Shock: How Tearing Up City Neighborhoods Hurt America, and What We Can Do About It  

**A fence is not only a fence. A highway is not simply a highway. The Chasm is Real.**  

At the University of Orange we say that _the city is our University_(link to AS about Everything you want to learn about US cities you can learn in Orange, NJ walking tours). That means that there are opportunities to learn everywhere we look - and everyday places and events can help us uncover clues about the health of the city. For instance, in Orange we’ve heard many times and from many people that it can be hard to connect, hard to find local resources, hard to reach out, hard to get people together. Why in a city of only 2.2 square miles does it feel so hard to bridge the gap? For us, seeing “fracture” like this is an important clue, and healing fracture is important work for every community.  

If there’s a problem in neighborhood there’s a problem in the city.
We first heard this at a 1993 Paris conference on AIDS, substance abuse, and homelessness.  French architect and urbanist Michel Cantal-Dupart delivered the opening address. Using the metaphor of the body, he pointed out that illness in one part of the body had to be treated with the whole body in mind.  We can’t solve the problems in our neighborhoods without understanding them in the context of the whole city. We call this practice city in mind.  “What is the problem we must solve?” Cantal also told us. “The fracture between the wealthy neighborhoods and the poor ones.”

We also have to take a few steps back and take an even longer view of the fracture we see in not only our city, but all cities. In the course of our fieldwork, we learned that urban fracture has been caused by a series of policies that have “sorted” American cities by race and class.  We were able to trace the effects of segregation, redlining, urban renewal, deindustrialization, mass incarceration, HOPE VI, the foreclosure crisis, and gentrification. This legacy of displacement is called “Serial Forced Displacement.”

[Here you can watch a short film we created, explaining Serial Forced Displacement.](https://vimeo.com/192820382)


These are some of the series of policies that are part of Serial Forced Displacement:

**Segregation**  
Segregation limited the spaces black citizens could occupy and the resources to which they had
Access. The fence in Orange Park only runs along the sides of the park that were traditionally black neighborhoods.

**Redlining**  
Beginning in 1935, the Federal Home Owners Loan Corporation sent people out to rate neighborhoods to guide investment. The ratings system gave low grades for areas with old buildings and high percentages of foreign born, Jewish or Negro residents, all considered “undesirable racial elements.” Most neighborhoods in Orange received C or D ratings becasue of the city's demographics and aging infrastructure.

**Urban Renewal**  
Under the Federal Housing Act of 1949, cities were able to declared areas “blighted,” seize the land using powers of eminent domain, and sell the cleared land to developers at a reduced price. Under urban renewal, 2,500 projects carried out in 993 American cities, displacing approximately one million people. Seventy-five percent of those displaced were people of color.  

**Highway Development**  
As early as the 1940s, freeways like 280 were seen as solutions to a perceived problem of urban slums with blighted housing. Thomas MacDonald, director of the Bureau of Public Roads concluded that “it is happy circumstance that living conditions for the family can be re-established [in the new suburbs] and permit the social and economic decay at the heart of cities to be converted to a public assets.” Highway 280 was built through the center of Orange in the 1960s, a decision that deeply effected the Black and Italian neighborhoods of Orange.

**Planned Shrinkage**  
Planned shrinkage was a policy of withdrawing public and private resources from targeted areas. In New York City in the 1970s, the closing of fire stations in poor neighborhoods led to massive destruction of housing, reaching 80% of some health areas.

**Deindustrialization**   
Deindustrialization is defined as the social and economic change caused by the removal of industrial capacity in a region. Orange was once home to a bustling hat-making industrial district.

**Mass incarceration**   
Mass Incarceration refers to shifts in criminal justice and policing policies that led to massive increases in the number of people under the authority of penal system. This increase has fallen severely on young black men.

**The Foreclosure Crisis**   
The Foreclosure Crisis refers to a widespread epidemic of foreclosures resulting from improper mortgages issued by banks and other lending agencies. Predatory policies led to many families loosing their homes through foreclosure.

**Gentrification**  
Gentrification is defined as the process of replacing lower income residents of an area with higher income residents. Ironworks, once home to youth-led arts collective ORNG Ink, is now rented out to tenants that can pay a higher rent.

Serial forced displacement is a particularly grave threat to health because it repeatedly attacks the very foundation of human health: the stable neighborhood that has intergenerational knowledge of how to survive in a given place.  Destruction of neighborhoods traumatizes people and destroys wealth of all kinds, including people’s economic, political, social, and cultural capital. Serial forced displacement is unjust and creates inequity.
