Young artists from Orange and the surrounding area transformed a former industrial building into a collective arts studio and gallery.  Ironworks was home to painters, fashion designers, filmmakers, musicians, hip hop artists, muralists, photographers, novelists, jouranlists and more.  The walls, floors and layout were always changing, alive with the creative process.  Everyone who visited knew it was like nowhere else they have ever been.  They will never forget.
