When archaeologists work, they dig into the ground to uncover stories of the past. In Orange, highway 280 cuts entirely through the middle of town, a site excavated but unexamined. University of Orange developed Reverse Archaeology with Chris Matthews and Kate McCaffrey from Montclair State Universty, to dig deeper into the story of Orange, NJ.
