title: The Old Embassy Theater
---
_In the 1950s and 1960s a Main Street wasn’t a Main Street without a brightly-lit marquee lighting up the streets in the night, and bustling with all kinds of activity during the day. Nowadays, it’s hard to find good entertainment within our city lines or without hopping in a car and driving off to another city at least 10 minutes away. Now, Main Street may still be, in its own way, bustling with people, but not in the same warm and inviting and leisurely way it did just half a century ago._

_Whenever we seek entertainment, a good laugh, or even a good cry in the 21st Century, we go to the movie theatres. Of course, the movies, and maybe the popcorn, is all that draws us to their locations, but is that the same reason they were popular back then? Now we have technology that can be applied to today’s movies, that couldn’t be applied back then, the kind of things that make the movies themselves so irresistible. But the old movie palaces had 2,000 seats that were often occupied with everyone from youth to elders. Could it be that the classic black and white movies that we lack appreciation for today, aren’t the only reason that the theatres were the highlight of Orange’s Main Street? What if, as crazy as it sounds, the actual theatres could draw people in and warm the hearts of so many people before they could even see the movies?_

_It’s not always the fact that they are playing movies that can allure people towards the theatre, but rather, the fact that people have memories in the theatre and can spend time with one another whilst still making new ones._

_“It was very attractive, but functionally obsolete,” said Dennis Monasebian to the Star-Ledger in October, 2005. Monasebian once owned Orange’s famous Embassy Theater which was torn down to make way for a parking lot. The theaters were torn down mainly because they were considered “obsolete” or in other words, “out of date,” although, nowadays people would pay some money to see some good classic films that their parents and grandparents once saw on a regular basis. The theaters’ popularity declined since Orange did not have a large enough population to sustain them.  In the same article Monasebian said, “The trouble is that buildings like this that were built 70 or 80 years ago don’t work anymore, unless they are in a densely populated area, like Manhattan or Newark.”_

_A 1960s theatre, with its shining bright name and classic yet vibrant interior, would, without a doubt, stand out, but who said that was a bad thing? Orange was so inviting and sociable back then, so what’s wrong with bringing a memento from those warm times into a whole other century? I know I would love to be able to see such a classic and beautiful building on our Main Street._
