Orange, NJ was once the hat-making capital of the United States. The corner of Freeman and South Jefferson Streets was where the famous Stetson Brothers had their first factory.  [As as student at the Orange Scholars’ Academy Schundnax Emmanuel told us what he loves about the former hat district. Watch here.](https://vimeo.com/117971496)  

Schundnax wrote an excerpt for _Our Orange: The Discovery of Our Past_, a textbook for Orange third graders, about the Hat-Making District in Orange:  

_Known as “Hat City,” Orange made and shipped hats to eager customers and businesses in the Tri-State area and around the world.  States such as Pennsylvania, New York, Conneticut, Delaware, and Maryland were big importers of the hats produced in the factories in Orange.  These hat factories were located in the Valley area of Orange and were built over a small tributary of the East Rahway River._ 

_Famous hat factories included the “No Name” Hat factory founded by the Stetson brothers.  No Name was located at the corner of Mitchell and South Jefferson in the Valley and the Berg Hat Factory on Nassau and South Jefferson Street._

_These factories provided employment to thousands of Orange residents. With customers waiting to get their hands on the elegant and beautiful hats, “Hat City” was working its way to the top. It was making a name for itself and getting a lot of glory. Making popular hats wasn’t easy, though. They needed funds and investments from important businesses and franchises._ 

_In order to secure cheaper labor and manufacturing costs, the owners of these hat factories relocated their business from the comfort and thriving industrial city that they helped to create with the hats. Today, the impressive buildings that housed these centers of the early American industrial age still stand awaiting their future and serving as a reminder of Orange’s rich and diverse history._
