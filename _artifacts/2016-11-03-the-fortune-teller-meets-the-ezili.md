Although most of my clients are children at this elementary school fair, a few parents stop by my table to have their cards read.  

As an opening gesture, before moving to the oracle cards, we start off with the Magic 8 Ball. Mattel released the black plastic toy ball in the 1950s and it can answer yes or no questions through a magic die that surfaces from murky blue water to a window on the bottom of ball. A majority of children I talk to at the fair want to know if they will be rich when they grow up. Because three quarters of the Magic 8 ball responses are positive or neutral, most of the news is good.   

The mother is thin and looks somewhat haggard. “Ask the Magic 8 ball a yes or no question,” I invite her. “Will I find a job?” she asks. “Don’t count on it,” the ball answers.  My heart sinks as the last thing I intend is to spread despair. This is clearly not the first setback this woman has experienced, and she processes the bad news. “They don’t want me to work yet,” she reflects, an answer that surprises me. As we move to the oracle cards, she starts explaining and teaching me about the Haitian spirits that are active and powerful forces in her life.   

Ezili Freda is a leading presence. Freda is part of the Vodou pantheon, one of several female spirits who belong to a group called the Ezili. “They like to represent her as white [here she takes the form of Our Lady of Sorrows] they give us permission to worship her [behind the façade of the Catholic deities],” explains the woman. Freda is the sensual and elegant, flirtatious and frustrated one and is associated with money and luck, love and luxury.  My client gives me instructions on how to please Freda:  

“You want to spray the area [around your altar], light candles and pray. Give her pink and white flowers, rose water, Pompeia lotion, sweets. She idolizes the mirror. She loves pink champagne—you can get a cheap bottle, $10—she flips out!” Freda is actively involved in my client’s life: “I dream about her… her messages are flirtatious. She appears to me naked. I ask myself, ‘why is she naked? I’m not gay.’  But the spirits have no specific sex. They are all men and women.”  

“These female spirits are both mirrors and maps,” writes Karen McCarthy Brown, an anthropologist who wrote the classic ethnography, Mama Vola: A Vodou Priestess in Brooklyn. In her book, Brown writes that Vodou spirits “[make] the present comprehensible and [offer] direction for the future…all the Vodou sprits clarify the options in people’s lives; and the Ezili do this especially well for women” (pg 221-222).  

A second spirit my client evokes is Ezile Danto, the hardworking, solitary, sometime raging mother.  Danto dresses in blue and appears as the Mater Salvatoris, a Polish black virgin known as Our Lady of Czestochowa. She has scars on her cheek, which Haitians trace back to the war for independence that she valiantly fought.  Her tongue was cut out. “It seems that Danto was rendered speechless by her own people, people fighting on the same side” writes Karen McCarthy Brown, “people who could not trust her to guard their secrets” (pg 229).   

Danto and Freda are two forces that guide my client through the uncertainties of everyday life.  “They intervene in life… when you are feeling mushy, your mind tells you what you need and what you don’t need—they help you know,” she explains.  “I dreamed of prosperity. That morning I caught the number 733. It proves they are listening. But you have to make sure you pay them. They broke my cell phone—it was broken in a strange way, so I know it was them.”  

“The Haitian religion is very powerful,” she explained to me. “You need to acknowledge the spirits. They appreciate being noticed.”
