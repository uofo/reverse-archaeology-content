It’s a brilliant Sunday afternoon. The sky is the same vibrant blue as the Salvadoran flags festooning South Day Street, a hard scrabble block bounded to the north by the enormous shell of Orange Memorial Hospital, and to the south by Freeway drive, a thoroughfare for cars spat off the interstate. Beyond Freeway drive lies the hard boundary of I-280 and its six lanes of high-speed traffic sunk in a canyon below street level. El Salvador restaurant anchors this struggling block of grassy lots and tenements with a flash of color and a fleet of vans that deliver “un pedacito de El Salvador” throughout the city of Orange. 

A generation ago, South Day Street was the heart of Orange’s Italian American community. Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Catholic Church, situated on the next corner, was built at the turn of the last century to serve the Italian Catholic community. Today its congregants are mostly Spanish speaking from Latin America.  This was an afternoon to celebrate those new residents.

September 24, 2016 marked the 8th annual “Festival Latino de Orange.” The street pulsed with music and people, strollers and blue Salvador sports shirts. The name “Latino festival” is a bit of a misnomer, as the festival has its origins in an effort to respect the diverse roots of Orange’s burgeoning Latin American community. According to Marcos Monroy, the festival founder and Salvadoran native, the Mayor approached him with the idea of celebrating Orange’s Latin American roots in August, a month when the Ecuadorian community commemorated its independence. Monroy bristled at the suggestion. “You wouldn’t like it if we forced you to celebrate the 4th of July in May,” he retorted. It was simply impossible to celebrate in the summer, Monroy explained, “In August, I don’t have patriotic sentiment.” In response, the Mayor suggested creating a new festival to include all the Central American and Mexican communities. Enthusiastic, Monroy embraced the challenge and pioneered a successful annual street fair that brings thousands of Orange’s Latin American residents together to celebrate Mexican and Central American independence.
