"This tragic news of the death of these two young men has disrupted the lives of not only their families, but everyone in the city and elsewhere, who can identify with senseless gun taking place in their communities," said Rev. Dr. Lanel D. Guyton, pastor of St. Matthew AME Church. "I have reached out to the Mayor of Orange, councilpersons, fellow clergy in Orange, East Orange and Newark to join us in a Unity Rally for Peace in the City of Orange. Let us disrupt our normal Sunday services and take the 'church to the street,' in support of this rally for peace."  

“Since 2012, I’ve had enough of black on black crime,” reflected Rev. Guyton six months after the April rally. “We called the whole community to come out and stand in the middle of the street and block traffic. We were there to disrupt violence. We wanted the community to know that we are out there. These killings spurred an effort to reach out to the Orange pastors—there was no collective voice. I asked all the pastors to come out, to bring them together to share issues and resources so we can have a collective voice.  

I didn’t want to get tangled in red tape and ideologies, but we did organize a coalition. We are trying to get the church to go out to the community to bring peace, to get kids to value their lives. We refuse to sit silent during this black on black crime here that is killing our neighborhoods and making positive initiatives difficult.”
