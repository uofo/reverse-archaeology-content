The Orange Free Public Library has been open for 130 years.  The library was designed by the architect Stanford White, whose firm also designed the original New York Penn Station and renovated wings of the White House. [Rosemary Iverson grew up in Orange and shares her memories of the library, watch her story here.](https://vimeo.com/190334424)
