When they were in the eighth grade Chennel Mahabir-Smith and Maya Suarez wrote about the First Presbyterian Church for the book Our Orange: The Discovery of our Past.  They researched the city and selected stories to share as a teaching tool for third graders.  Here is what they found about the church:  

_“Ye who reads this must die!” it says on the corner of Main Street and Scotland Road. But don’t be afraid. This isn’t meant to scare you. It’s what’s carved into a tombstone in a Colonial-era graveyard at the First Presbyterian Church and Cemetery, a gateway to Orange and one of Orange’s most valuable remnants of its history._  

_“For 108 years this church was the only religious society in the community. The Meeting House was also the center of civic and patriotic life and there on April 13, 1807, the town government of Orange was inaugurated and the first town officers were elected.” These words are carved into a plaque on the front of the First Presbyterian Church._  

_At first glimpse, you think of the First Presbyterian Church as just an old, run-down building next to some tombstones or that it’s the house of the dead. You think that there is no importance or historical connection to it. You’re unaware of its spiritual links to the people of Orange and how much it really affects our community to this day. But as we learned, the church is truly one of our many hidden treasures._
