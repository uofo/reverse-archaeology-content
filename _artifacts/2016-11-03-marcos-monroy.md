Did most folks from El Salvador arrive during the civil war, or more recently? He thought about it for a minute. The civil war, he decided. Do people want to go back or stay here? Do they build homes in El Salvador and dream about retiring there? There’s a lot of dreaming he thinks. Some people buy property. But one thing he has noticed is that people have started burying their dead here. They used to fly the bodies back to El Salvador for burials. Now they are burying them here. He sees a lot because of his restaurant. Sometimes people won’t be able to afford a funeral and will leave a collection cup in his restaurant.  

Monroy left El Salvador during its civil war to avoid being conscripted into the army. Once you hit 18 it was particularly dangerous. The government could draft young men and they’d be forced into the war. The guerrillas were always looking for recruits as well. Up until 18, the best strategy was to keep a low profile and avoid public gathering places.  Sometimes, the government would show up with trucks and round up young men as a kind of ad hoc draft.  The guerrillas regarded these truckloads of men heading to the military bases as a prime target. They saw it as a way of preventing the expansion of the army. El Salvador is very mountainous with large volcanoes. The guerrillas would hide in the volcanoes and the roads ran between them in the valley. The guerrillas would bomb the trucks loaded with new recruits/conscripts below. Monroy said that quite a few people died that way.  When he turned 18 and there was now the additional threat of a letter arriving at house drafting him into the war, he decided to leave.  

He endured 9 years of civil war. The department he lived in saw quite a bit of violence—bodies on the street. His family had to move 4 times when he was growing up. Everything was disrupted, schooling, work, etc.  

Monroy went back to El Salvador recently. He stayed away from El Salvador for 17 years. Why? Political reasons? Economic reasons? Why so long?   

 “When you flee, like I did, you don’t want to go back. You are afraid. You want to stay here. You appreciate the safety.”  He also mentioned that he initially had temporary immigration status and didn’t want to jeopardize his status in anyway by leaving.  

How does he feel now?   

“Now I’m falling in love with my country again.”
