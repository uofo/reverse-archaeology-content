Darline Allen’s mother was drawn to the U.S. by the lure of factory work. These jobs dried up shortly after she left Haiti and she ended up working in McDonald’s. Many Haitians work in the fast food industry. Allen’s mother worked in McDonald’s for 5-6 years. Eventually, she went into the medical field and she is now a registered nurse.  Essex County College was a huge help to her mother and many Haitian immigrants.   

Allen came to the U.S. years after her mother. “She left me when I was one. I came when I was 6 or 7. I was raised by my mother’s sister and the extended family.” Allen explained, though, that she didn’t feel abandoned—this is the way it is in Haiti: the family raises you. Allen calls her aunt “mother” just as she calls her mother “mother.”  

“What is your dream?” Allen likes to ask young people. “Life is not just about money—what do you want to do?” She sees her role in life as “to LEAD, MOTIVATE and INSPIRE. I discovered that even though I’m not a great dancer, I can teach dance. I can help others find their purpose. Language doesn’t have to be a barrier—you don’t have to speak the same language to communicate—a smile can convey so much. Love is a universal language.”  

“Too often people are too materialistic. When I volunteered in hospice, I encountered people who were full of regret, who said ‘I didn’t live my life.’ Immigrants work, work, work, all week. They go to church on Sunday and Wednesday. Other than that there’s nothing. They don’t have lives.”   

Allen asks people “What is your self worth?” If someone can’t read or write, she explains that it’s not that they have failed. “It’s that I haven’t found the right way to teach you.” Some people are visual, she notes: people have different learning styles.  When she worked in the dance studio she liked to single out the kids that were regarded as the “worst” kids. She would tell them, “I see you going to college. I think you should think about graduate school.” A student responded to her “I’m too dumb to get a masters degree.” She wants to work against this kind of thinking. “There is so much talent in the youth—I want to encourage them to do what they love.”
