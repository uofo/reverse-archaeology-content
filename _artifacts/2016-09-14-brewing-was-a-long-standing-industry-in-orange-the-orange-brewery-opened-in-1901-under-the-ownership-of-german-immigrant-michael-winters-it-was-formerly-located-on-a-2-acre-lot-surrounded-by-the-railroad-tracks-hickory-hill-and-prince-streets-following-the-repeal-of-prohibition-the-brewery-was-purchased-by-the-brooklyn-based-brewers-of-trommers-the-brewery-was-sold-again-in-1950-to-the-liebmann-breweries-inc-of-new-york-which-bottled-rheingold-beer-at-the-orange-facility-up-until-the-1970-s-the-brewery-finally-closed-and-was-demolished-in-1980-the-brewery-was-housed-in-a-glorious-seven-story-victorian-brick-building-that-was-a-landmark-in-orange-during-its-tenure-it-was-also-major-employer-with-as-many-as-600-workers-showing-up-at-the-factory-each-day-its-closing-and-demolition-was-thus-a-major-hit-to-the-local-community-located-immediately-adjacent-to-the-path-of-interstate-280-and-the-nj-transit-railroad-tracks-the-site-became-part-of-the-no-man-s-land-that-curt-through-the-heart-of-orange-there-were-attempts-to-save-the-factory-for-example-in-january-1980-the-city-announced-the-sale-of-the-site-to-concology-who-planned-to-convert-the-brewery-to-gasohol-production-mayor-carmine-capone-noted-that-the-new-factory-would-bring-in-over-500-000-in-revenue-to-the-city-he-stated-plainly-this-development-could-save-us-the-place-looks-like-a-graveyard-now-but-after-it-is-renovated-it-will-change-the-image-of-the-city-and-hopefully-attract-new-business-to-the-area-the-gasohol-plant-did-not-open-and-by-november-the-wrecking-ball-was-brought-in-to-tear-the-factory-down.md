  Brewing was a long standing industry in Orange. The Orange Brewery opened in
  1901 under the ownership of German immigrant Michael Winters. It was formerly
  located on a 2-acre lot surrounded by the Railroad tracks, Hickory, Hill, and
  Prince Streets. Following the repeal of prohibition the brewery was purchased
  by the Brooklyn-based brewers of Trommers. The brewery was sold again in 1950
  to the Liebmann Breweries, Inc. of New York, which bottled Rheingold Beer at
  the Orange facility up until the 1970's. The brewery finally closed and was
  demolished in 1980.   The brewery was housed in a glorious seven story
  Victorian brick building that was a landmark in Orange during its tenure. It
  was also major employer with as many as 600 workers showing up at the factory
  each day. Its closing and demolition was thus a major hit to the local
  community. Located immediately adjacent to the path of Interstate 280 and the
  NJ Transit railroad tracks, the site became part of the no-man’s land that
  curt through the heart of Orange.  There were attempts to  save the factory.
  For example in January 1980, the city announced the sale of the site to
  ConCology, who planned to convert the brewery to gasohol production. Mayor
  Carmine Capone noted that the new factory would bring in over $500,000 in
  revenue to the city. He stated plainly: “This development could save us … The
  place looks like a graveyard now, but after it is renovated it will change the
  image of the city and hopefully attract new business to the area.” The gasohol
  plant did not open and by November the wrecking ball was brought in to tear
  the factory down.
