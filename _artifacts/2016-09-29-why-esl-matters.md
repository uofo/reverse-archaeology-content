headline: Why ESL Matters
---
To succeed in the U.S. economy today, new immigrants must master English. In the past, when factory jobs were more abundant, it was possible to get a good job with rudimentary English. Today’s service oriented workforce is not so accommodating. New immigrants are pressed by the need to pay rent and bills and provide for their families (both in the U.S. and back home) while they are still getting a footing in a new, foreign place. They need English to have a chance at staying afloat.

While learning English is the gateway to success, immigrants often struggle to find classes that are free or low-cost, have available slots, and are offered at times that coordinate with home and work schedules. Frequently, immigrants have limited literacy in their own language, which makes acquiring a new language as an adult all the more daunting.

Immigrant women may delay learning English for years after they arrive in the States. Their double burden of paid work and unpaid domestic labor makes it hard to find time for classes. Furthermore, when women are socialized to be unassuming and quiet, this interferes with language acquisition, which benefits from active practice and confidence. Unfortunately, lack of English language skill may disadvantage women not only in the workplace, but in the family. When the adult man in the household, through either ESL classes, or more active English language practice, masters English before the adult woman, this may cause a subtle shift in household power dynamics. For example, a Salvadoran man reported that his daughter doesn’t trust her mother to help with homework. The child knows that her mother doesn’t speak English, so she always double checks her homework with her father, believing that her mother doesn’t know what she’s doing.  Lack of English proficiency, therefore, may undercut a mother’s authority in the domestic sphere, a traditional area of female power.  In addition, children take on an adult role as they translate the English-speaking world, and institutions of power (schools, government agencies) to their parents, thus undermining both male and female parental authority.

**Field Notes:** 

**October 2015 Orange Adult School ESL class**

During the fall, the Orange Adult School offers two sections of ESL at Rosa Parks Elementary School. Two nights a week, from 6-9 PM, adult learners squeeze into child-sized desks in a clean, orderly classroom. They periodically gaze around the room at all the posters and signs on the wall, which extort children to try harder, believe in themselves, and succeed. Some of these adult learners have children who attend this school; roles are reversed in the evening as the parents occupy their children’s seats.

The classes fill up quickly and have a waiting list. One night in October, 12 students were ready at their desks, waiting patiently for the instructor. The class started around 6:15. One man arrived at 6:30 in paint-speckled clothes, with wet hair slicked back, but was turned away because he wasn’t on the class roster. Although there were 12 students that Thursday night, the instructor said there were 20 the previous Tuesday. 

Class was composed of two Haitian women, one pregnant with her second child, and another older woman, eyes bloodshot with fatigue. These two women sat together. The rest of the class was Latin American. Two husband-wife couples (a weeknight date?) sat together. One small, dark man sat by himself, really struggled with rudimentary English, but seemed to be incorporated into the larger group at break. There were five other women. Most of the students appeared to be relatively young, in their late 20s and 30s. There was a palpable communal spirit and sense of rapport among the students—perhaps in part because the teacher was slow and there was airtime that students could fill explaining things to each other. 

It seemed that only two students were really struggling.  The teacher chattered continuously in English. Most students seemed to understand her, and mostly answered her questions correctly—months, weather, introducing themselves, basic conjugation of “to be.” One man was very strong and asked a lot of questions. A number of students felt comfortable asking questions. The level of literacy seemed high.

Students were asked to introduce themselves. My favorite was “Edison”—did he live in West Orange? Professions included: warehouse worker, landscaper, dry cleaner, babysitter, construction worker, laundry worker, housekeeper.

The teacher told me that the students were mostly from El Salvador. This did not match up with my informal chatting at break. I spoke to three women—one from Mexico, one from Ecuador, and one from Guatemala. At break, the students sat in language clusters, which also took on a racial dimension. The two Haitian women from one class sat together. Three Latin American together women clustered. Across from them, four Haitian women and one woman from Eritrea sat together. I was interested that the Eritrean sat with the Haitians. They identified her to me as African. Where are you from, I asked her? “Africa” she responded. From where? “East Africa.” From where in East Africa? “Ethiopia.” “Ah,” I replied, “There are a lot of Eritreans around here.” “I’m from Eritrea,” she exclaimed in surprise. 

**Lanbi ESL February 2016**

We met in the parish hall since the boiler is still out in the church.  I worked with K. and A. Both women are in their 50s with grown children and are really hard workers—devoted and loyal. A. says that she likes to come to class and she enjoys her English homework. K. is modest, and says she’s not good at English and is afraid to come to class—I think she’s teasing, but there’s a little anxiety.

K.’s phone rings several times throughout the class and finally in exasperation she answers it. The director approaches her and tells her she has to put the phone on silent. I’m so impressed by his decorum! The ESL program is a fascinating blend of gentle, approachable and accessible teaching and discipline. The overall impression: dignity.

K. and A. are both deeply religious. There are several ESL prompt cards that I bring with me. One question: “What is the best way to achieve peace in the world?” K. can’t answer this question. “It’s not up to me, it’s up to God.” A. agrees. “There is nothing we can do. This is god’s domain.” Another prompt asks which famous person you would like to meet. A. wants to meet a pastor in Long Island to ask him to pray for her. K. wants to meet the pastor across the street.

Question: What do you dream about? A: I dream about my children’s education.

Question: What do you think of the police? K. likes the police: she thinks they are kind and provide security. She has had no personal encounters, though, with the police. A. recounts a story about how a police officer stayed with her for an hour when she was dizzy and had to pull over to the side of the road. Another time when she accidently ran through a new stop sign; she apologized and was let go without a ticket. I mentioned that some of my students had negative encounters with the police and felt that black men were pulled over disproportionately. A. seemed sympathetic, but K. didn’t want to hear it. I told them I suggested that the men should burst into tears to get out of the ticket. K. softened into a smile.

“My favorite color is black, like me!” AN

This was a really interesting conversation. One of the conversational prompts the ESL students had to work with was what was their favorite color and why. AN responded black. My first reaction was that he meant black as in mourning and perhaps he was depressed! But it became clear that it was a “negritude” answer. He said he liked black because he was black. He struggled to explain more. He liked his brown eyes and the way his teeth shone when he smiled. When I pointed to my purse and asked him how he felt about that color black, he shook his head no and pointed to his arm. 

A question about the zodiac signs inspired a bit of a religious backlash. Both A. and K. clearly thought it was pagan nonsense and wanted to have nothing to do with it. They were disturbed that people would listen to such prattle and not the true word of God.

I tried to explain a parable to them “The more noble a person is, the more humble.” (something like that).  I said the best example I could think of was Jesus, because he was the son of god and he washed his disciples’ feet. They nodded in agreement. Then I mentioned that the Pope had done the same last week, and A. lit up with delight. “Did you see the picture of the Pope washing the feet of the black child?” (actually I had only seen the Syrian refugees—I looked up the photo she referred to). She was very moved.

One of the prompts asked the students about birth order/family size. They all came from big families. AN was 4 out of 8. A. was 8 out of 10. K. was 2 out of 7, I believe. K. said that her father was one of 21, or something like that.  All three of them have 4 children.

When we reviewed an American saying, “You are what you drive,” K. dismissed it. “In Haiti people don’t have cars. That is definitely an American saying.”

At the end of the class, I asked them if they wanted homework. Oh yes, they readily agreed. K. approached me about the computer class-were we going to be able to offer a computer class on Fridays? This is a big disappointment. I was disappointed that three different MSU students who had promised to teach had each dropped out for different reasons at the last minute. I haven’t been able to give Lanbi the staff it needs to launch the program. “It’s true,” Martial, joked, “we’ve never encountered an obstacle before.” These are people who persist! 

**Lanbi May 2016**

Martial comes every Tuesday to ESL class in Orange from his NY job, no matter how late. Rodrigue really runs the show with his constant, consistent presence.  The table of “beginning” women learners gets larger and larger. My intermediate conversational crew is more constant at 3-4 students.

A. is rock solid. Accustomed to church discipline, she comes every Tuesday and Wednesday night and has been coming for years. She has been in the U.S. for 30 years. K. teased her last week about forgetting her country, she’s been in the U.S. for so long. Both K. and KN were critical that A. hadn’t visited Haiti recently. KN proudly noted that she returns to Haiti every year. Her mother lives there. She and her husband own a bar and she needs to check on it. But KN last week let it slip out that she likes to party. Horrors! K fell silent, probably anticipating A’s response.  A gently chided KN—why does she do that? Doesn’t she know that God will make her feel better?  KN protested that she goes to church, but she likes to go out! She’s 27! A. was skeptical and offered to bring her to church.
