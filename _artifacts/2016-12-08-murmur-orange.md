In 2009, HANDS, Inc, got funding to carry out a digital storytelling project.  The initial funding was augmented by a grant from the Kenworthy-Swift Foundation, permitting HANDS to hire high school students to collect and edit the stories.  HANDS contracted with Toronto-based [murmur] to use their process collecting stories on the site where it happened.  Robin Elliott and Shawn Micallef of [murmur] called this “hear about here.”  Molly Rose Kaufman and Mike Malbrough led the summer project which collected stories about many happenings, including a ghost story, a visit to Orange by Reverend Dr. Martin King, Jr, the week before he was assassinated, and a prize-winning outfit at a middle school dance.  With the technical supervision of a radio reporter, the teens were able to produce professional stories that were posted on the [murmur] website.  Shawn Micallef came to Orange to post signs in the shape of green ears that included a phone number to call.  Each sign had a unique code number.  When one telephoned, one could hear a man’s voice murmuring, “This is [murmur], what’s the code?”  On entering the code, one could hear the story of the place.  The 30 [murmur] stories started the process of collecting the stories of Orange, carried forwarded in the Hidden Treasures of Our Orange initiative and in the Reverse Archaeology Project.  Each project has added layers to our understanding of the diversity and delight of the most historic city in the United States. You'll find [murmur] stories throughout the Hidden Treasure archives.
