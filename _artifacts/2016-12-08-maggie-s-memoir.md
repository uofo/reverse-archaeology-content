Maggie Thompson wrote her memoir at 91.  She called it _From One to Ninety One: A Life_.  She lived at 397 Olcott Street, across the street from Orange Park, for many years. With her daughter Mindy Fullilove and her granddaughter Molly Kaufman, she was a founder of the University of Orange.  
Maggie received her FreeD, University of Orange’s highest degree, for writing the memoir.  Until the book launch party, on July 16, 2011, at Luna Stage, Maggie had thought of her life as unremarkable, and perhaps ineffective.  The eager, standing-room-only crowd, and thoughtful readings by friends and family, helped her to see her life in a new way.  She was so uplifted by this experience that she “craved it for other people.”  She started a project, called Maggie Ink, to help poor and elderly people write their stories.
