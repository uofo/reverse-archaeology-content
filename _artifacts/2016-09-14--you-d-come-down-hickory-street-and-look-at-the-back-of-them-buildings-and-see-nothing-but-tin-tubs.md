Like many others in the African American and Italian American neighborhoods interveiwed, Mildred Harris grew up in a home without hot water. Families would heat water on the stove to use for cooking and laundry as well as bathing. Ms. Harris remembers that homes up and down Central Place had tin tubs hanging on their back walls from nails. Tin tubs would get pulled into the house so people could take baths. They were long so “two babies or two kids could get in there to save water.” 

Harris was prompted to tell this story because she also remembered how excited her mother was to move into the new Walter G. Alexander apartments in 1955. She remembers that “they were new and they were nice … because they had a bathtub so we did not have to pull the tin tub out. She liked that … There was running hot water, and I said, whoo baby, that’s living!”

The Alexander apartments were a public houseing project. Harris remenmbers it being “good” from 1955 through  the early 60s. “You had seniors in there, people took care of each other, they were beautiful.” Then things got “bad” in the in the 60s after they started the highway. Then “you couldn’t even get up the steps in that place … with the drugs, that was their territory.”
