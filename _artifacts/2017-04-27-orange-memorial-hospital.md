[Listen to a story about the hospital from [murmur]](https://soundcloud.com/murmur-orange-nj/orange-memorial-deborah-allen)

_The fog seeps out of the shell of what was once Orange Memorial Hospital, creating a haunting experience for people walking by._

_In 2004 the Orange Memorial Hospital closed after serving the Orange community since its opening in 1873. This hospital was an essential part of this town, providing jobs and medical assistance. It gave the residents of Orange fast medical assistance without going to other hospitals out of the town._

_The hospital was not just a hospital. It was home to the Orange Memorial Hospital School of Nursing, located in Mary Austin Hall. Now there aren’t any nursing schools in Orange, NJ, which makes it difficult for the people who have to travel for a nursing school._

_Orange Memorial Hospital was more than a hospital. Jobs play a huge part in a city. Jobs attract people to a city. The hospital provided many jobs for the community and it also made the businesses surrounding the hospital boom with business. The hospital brought laundromats, convenience stores, and a pharmacy. Many people who were working or were patients in the hospital would go and wash their clothes at the laundromat, or take their prescriptions to the pharmacy. When the hospital shut down, many residents lost their jobs. The businesses lost customers, which cost them money and they had to depend on faithful customers._

_The closing of the hospital also affected the residents of Orange that can’t have immediate attention. The hospital helped the city grow and become safer. Imagine how people felt when it shut down. Imagine all the people who have been hurt and couldn’t get immediate attention.  Life must have been hard for the Orange residents._

_There’s a story told in Orange that a young boy got hit by a car right in front of the hospital the day after the hospital closed. He died because he couldn’t get help. There was also this elderly lady that had a stroke and couldn’t get help. She was taken to another hospital but they didn’t have space for her and she was transferred to another hospital. Luckily, she survived but there were many unfortunate people who didn’t._

_There was always hope that someone would buy the hospital and rebuild it. A new hospital would change Orange completely and also help rebuild the city from the broken-down city image it has. There are many reasons that the hospital had to close down. Different parts of the hospital closed down on different days while the Emergency Room remained open until May 26, 2004. Orange Memorial Hospital remains in the same place but broken down. There is now asbestos in the hospital which can cause lung cancer to anyone that goes in there. The hospital has many broken windows and graffiti on the walls._

_There have been developers that have bought the hospital but the problem is that it is economically impossible to make another hospital. The plan is to build residential houses._	

_Orange Memorial was an essential part of Orange and it affected Orange more than anybody thinks. The job opportunities went away, as well as the medical attention.  Many residents today hope to see a new Orange Memorial Hospital in the future and it can with your help._
