University of Orange is committed to recording and sharing people’s stories about Orange, NJ.  Place-based storytelling is a useful way to start and inform conversations about the communities in which we live. Sharing our stories helps us plan for the future collectively.  By exploring what has been we expand the realm of what can be.


Our multidisciplinary team deploys a variety of methods to record and share stories including walking tours, interviews, participatory action research, “reverse archaeology” and more. We collect and tell stories of the city in free classes, workshops, street side lemonade stands, ESL courses, scavenger hunts and more.
