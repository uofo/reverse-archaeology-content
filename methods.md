University of Orange is committed to recording and sharing people’s stories about Orange, NJ.  Place-based storytelling is a key part of our urbanism practice. It is a useful way to start and inform conversations about the communities in which we live. Sharing our stories helps us plan for the future collectively.  By exploring what has been we expand the realm of what can be.


Our multidisciplinary team deploys multiple methods to record and share stories including walking tours, interviews, participatory action research, “reverse archaeology” and more. We’ve used these methods in a number of ways like free classes, workshops, lemonade stands, ESL courses, scavenger hunts and more.
