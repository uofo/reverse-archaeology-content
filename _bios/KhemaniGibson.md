Khemani Gibson was born in Kingston, Jamaica. He migrated with his parents and settled in Orange, NJ in the early 1990s. Growing up, Khemani always loved storytelling and history ranging from the Anansi stories his mother told her children, to learning about notable black figures such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Billie Holiday, Jackie Robinson and others during Black History Month. In high school, Khemani participated in the [murmur] oral history project where he interviewed Orange residents and learned about the rich history that existed in his hometown. Prior to that project, Khemani viewed Orange negatively and couldn't wait to leave for college. However, the project taught Khemani the beauty of uncovering lost histories of people and places. For this reason, Khemani studied history at Drew University.  Inspired by the lessons he learned from  [murmur] and his love for good storytelling, he began to uncover the history of his own family, with a focus on their migration to Panama during the construction of the canal. He also served as a consultant on the Hidden Treasures and _Our Orange: The Discovery of Our Past_ projects, working with students from the Humanities core at the Scholars' Academy as they learned about the richness of Orange's history. Currently, Khemani is a history PhD Candidate at New York University, where he studies the lives and communities of black immigrants in twentieth century Panama.  He is also a community organizer in Orange, seeking to increase youth civic and social participation in his hometown.
