Ron Morrison is a designer and social practitioner. He works to create strategies using art and design that help people understand how urban systems work and how to work within them. With a strong background in community development and social advocacy, he believes that people should have participatory access to shaping their cities and communities and sees design as a medium for creating knowledge and moving beyond paralysis in the face of complexity. His current work investigates infrastructure as a sociotechnical system for crafting the design of more equitable and sustainable services.
