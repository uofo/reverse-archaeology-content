Katherine McCaffrey is an associate professor of anthropology at Montclair State University.  Her research interests focus on social inequality, its consequences and resistance to it in Latin America and the United States. Her interest in social movements took her to Vieques, Puerto Rico where she examined a multi-decade long movement to evict the Navy from the island described in her book, Military Power and Popular Protest: the U.S. Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico.  She is currently finishing a manuscript about the contested Navy-led environmental cleanup of Vieques.   


More recently, she has been conducting participatory action field research in Orange, New Jersey, a compact, diverse city that showcases a larger pattern of urban disinvestment, abandonment, and demolition by neglect and design. Working closely with Lanbi, a Haitian civic association, as well as the University of Orange, she is examining how nascent efforts by grassroots citizen groups may form a bulwark against displacement.  


Committed to claiming a public voice for anthropology, McCaffrey was a founding editor of _Anthropology Now_, where she served as the general editor for seven years. Right now, in an effort to combat xenophobia and foster cultural exchange, she co-founded, with Melina Macall, [the Syrian Supper Club, recently featured on CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/us/syrian-refugees-new-jersey-camerota/#) and recommended as a way to help Syrian Refugees on the SamanthaBee.com site.
