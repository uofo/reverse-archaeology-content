Mike Malbrough was born in Reisterstown, Maryland where he learned to draw and tell stories with art gypsies in his hometown. When he was all grown up he moved to New Jersey where he worked as an illustrator for 10 years. After an eternity of client-centered work in comics, apparel, advertising and beyond, Mike rediscovered the world of picture books in 2015. By the summer of 2016, Mike found a home for his debut picture book Marigold Bakes a Cake with Philomel Books, an imprint of Penguin/Randomhouse. Mike is also the director of ORNG Ink, a young artist collective, and has received several awards and honors for his work in Orange, NJ with children and teens.
